# COVID19 Argentina Tracker
This is a live project to track the Covid19 situation in Argentina. 
Is evolving day by day as the Covid19 pandemic.

The mayor goal is to convert the first version written in Vanilla JS to a PWA VueJS based, consuming a Headless CMS.

## Github
[covid19 Repo](https://github.com/Manumac86/covid19)
I've implemented Actions to build and deploy frontend. 
Right now, the data is hardcoded within `api/apiData.js` but eventually will be consumed from a CMS (Probably Strapi based API).

## Deployment
I'm using Firebase to host [Covid19 Argentina Tracker](https://covid19.manumac.com.ar) with a custom domain [covid19.manumac.com.ar](https://covid19.manumac.com.ar).
